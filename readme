🎯 Project Overview

This research explored Digital Twin technology for sustainable farming. It progressed from single-plant monitoring (2023) to complex aquaponics ecosystem management (2026), using AWS IoT services to monitor, analyze, and optimize environmental conditions for plants and fish.

Key Outcomes:
	•	Real-time remote monitoring of crops and aquaponics systems
	•	Data-driven decision-making to optimize resources and yield
	•	Scalable digital twin architecture adaptable to single or multi-component systems

💡 What is a Digital Twin?

A Digital Twin is a virtual replica of a physical system that:
	•	Receives real-time data from IoT sensors
	•	Mirrors the system’s current state and behavior
	•	Enables simulation and predictive analytics
	•	Supports remote monitoring and control

In agriculture, it empowers farmers to optimize water, nutrients, and environmental conditions, while predicting outcomes and proactively addressing issues.
