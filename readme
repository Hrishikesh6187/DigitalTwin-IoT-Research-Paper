## 🧠 Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Real-time data synchronization across distributed sensors
**Problem:** Multiple sensors updating asynchronously caused data inconsistency in digital twin  
**Solution:** Implemented timestamp-based data aggregation in Lambda function. Buffered sensor readings within 5-second windows before updating digital twin state, ensuring coherent system representation.

### Challenge 2: Sensor calibration drift over multi-month deployment
**Problem:** pH and turbidity sensors showed calibration drift after 2-3 months of continuous operation  
**Solution:** Developed automated calibration routines triggered weekly. Raspberry Pi prompted manual recalibration checks, and Lambda functions applied correction factors based on known reference values.

### Challenge 3: Cost optimization for long-term data storage
**Problem:** Storing high-frequency sensor data in Timestream incurred escalating costs  
**Solution:** Implemented tiered retention policy: 24-hour memory storage for real-time queries, 7-day magnetic storage for recent analysis, monthly aggregates for long-term trends. Reduced storage costs by 70%.

### Challenge 4: 3D model creation for aquaponics system
**Problem:** No pre-existing 3D models for custom aquaponics setup  
**Solution:** Used iPhone LiDAR scanner with 3D Scanner App to capture physical system. Processed scan data and imported into TwinMaker. Result: accurate 3D replica with <5cm spatial error.

### Challenge 5: Lambda cold start latency affecting real-time monitoring
**Problem:** Infrequent sensor updates caused Lambda cold starts (2-3 second delays)  
**Solution:** Configured provisioned concurrency for Lambda functions handling critical sensor streams. Reduced P95 latency from 2.5s to 200ms.

### Challenge 6: Visualizing multi-parameter correlations in Grafana
**Problem:** Standard time-series charts failed to show relationships between pH, turbidity, and temperature  
**Solution:** Created custom Grafana panels with multi-axis overlays and correlation heatmaps. Enabled identification of parameter dependencies (e.g., temperature affecting pH levels).
